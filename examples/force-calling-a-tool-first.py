# # How to force an agent to call a tool
#
# In this example we will build a ReAct agent that **always** calls a certain tool first, before making any plans. In this example, we will create an agent with a search tool. However, at the start we will force the agent to call the search tool (and then let it do whatever it wants after). This is useful when you know you want to execute specific actions in your application but also want the flexibility of letting the LLM follow up on the user's query after going through that fixed sequence.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup
#
# First we need to install the packages required

# %%
# %%capture --no-stderr
# %pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain langchain_openai tavily-python

# %% [markdown]
# Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use) and Tavily (the search tool we will use)

# %%
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Tavily API Key:")

# %% [markdown]
# Optionally, we can set API key for [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/), which will give us best-in-class observability.

# %%
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LangSmith API Key:")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Set up the tools
#
# We will first define the tools we want to use.
# For this simple example, we will use a built-in search tool via Tavily.
# However, it is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_tools) on how to do that.
#

# %%
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]

# %% [markdown]
# We can now wrap these tools in a simple ToolExecutor.
# This is a real simple class that takes in a ToolInvocation and calls that tool, returning the output.
# A ToolInvocation is any class with `tool` and `tool_input` attribute.
#

# %%
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolExecutor

tool_executor = ToolExecutor(tools)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Set up the model
#
# Now we need to load the chat model we want to use.
# Importantly, this should satisfy two criteria:
#
# 1. It should work with messages. We will represent all agent state in the form of messages, so it needs to be able to work well with them.
# 2. It should work with OpenAI function calling. This means it should either be an OpenAI model or a model that exposes a similar interface.
#
# Note: these model requirements are not requirements for using LangGraph - they are just requirements for this one example.
#

# %%
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# We will set streaming=True so that we can stream tokens
# See the streaming section for more information on this.
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, streaming=True)

# %% [markdown]
#
# After we've done this, we should make sure the model knows that it has these tools available to call.
# We can do this by converting the LangChain tools into the format for OpenAI function calling, and then bind them to the model class.
#

# %%
model = model.bind_tools(tools)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Define the agent state
#
# The main type of graph in `langgraph` is the `StatefulGraph`.
# This graph is parameterized by a state object that it passes around to each node.
# Each node then returns operations to update that state.
# These operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute.
# Whether to set or add is denoted by annotating the state object you construct the graph with.
#
# For this example, the state we will track will just be a list of messages.
# We want each node to just add messages to that list.
# Therefore, we will use a `TypedDict` with one key (`messages`) and annotate it so that the `messages` attribute is always added to.
#

# %%
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Sequence, TypedDict

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage


class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]


# %% [markdown]
# ## Define the nodes
#
# We now need to define a few different nodes in our graph.
# In `langgraph`, a node can be either a function or a [runnable](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/).
# There are two main nodes we need for this:
#
# 1. The agent: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.
# 2. A function to invoke tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.
#
# We will also need to define some edges.
# Some of these edges may be conditional.
# The reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken.
# The path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).
#
# 1. Conditional Edge: after the agent is called, we should either:
#    a. If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools should be called
#    b. If the agent said that it was finished, then it should finish
# 2. Normal Edge: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do next
#
# Let's define the nodes, as well as a function to decide how what conditional edge to take.
#
